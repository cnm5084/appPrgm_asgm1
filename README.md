i.  App name + description

App Name : Fuel Cost Calculator

Description : This Flutter app helps users estimate the total fuel cost for a journey based on travel distance, car fuel efficiency, fuel type, and location. 
			  It provides a quick, simple, and user-friendly way to calculate expenses before travelling.

ii.  Inputs → Process → Output explanation
	Inputs:  
		Distance to travel (in kilometers)
		Car fuel efficiency (in km per liter)
		Type of fuel (RON95, RON97, or Diesel)
		Location (Peninsular Malaysia or East Malaysia)
	Process: 
		Validate that both distance and efficiency are numeric and not empty.
		Based on selected fuel type and location, apply fuel price per liter:
		RON95 → RM2.60
		RON97 → RM3.14
		Diesel → RM2.89 (Peninsular) / RM2.15 (East Malaysia)
		Calculate total cost using formula:
			Total Cost = (Distance / Efficiency) * Fuel Price
	Output: 
		Displays the estimated total fuel cost in Ringgit Malaysia (RM).
		Shows a success message (“Successful!”) after a valid calculation.

	Scaffold
	AppBar
	SingleChildScrollView
	Center
	Container

iv. Basic Validation Approach
	Used Form widget with a _formKey for validation.
	Each TextFormField checks:
	If the field is empty → returns 'Distance can’t be empty' or 'Efficiency can’t be empty'.
	If the input is not numeric → returns 'Please enter number'.
	Validation must pass before the calculation executes.
	Reset button clears all input fields and resets dropdowns to default.
